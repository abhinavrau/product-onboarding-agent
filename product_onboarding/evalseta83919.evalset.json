It has strong processing capabilities and supports various payment types, inventory management, order management, customer engagement, employee management, reporting, and online ordering integration.\n\n2.  **ACME Corp Mini:** This is also a stationary, compact countertop system suitable for retail, quick-service restaurants, and services.
